Get a $25 credit when you try Ting at https://vox.ting.com\n\nBecome a Vox Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nMost fish die the same way — slow suffocation in the open air. It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid. Those chemicals make the fish taste bad, smell “fishy,” and rot quickly. \n\nBut there's a better way: a four-step Japanese method called ikejime. It involves sharp knives. And a brain spike. \n\nWe adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare \n\nCat Ferguson wrote a detailed article on the process at Topic: https://www.topic.com/how-to-kill-a-fish \n\nThis article about fish and pain from the Smithsonian informed reporting: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/fish-feel-pain-180967764/ \n\nAnd here’s a link to the Ike Jime Federation, where Andrew is the president: https://www.ikejimefederation.com/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
