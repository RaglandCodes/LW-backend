It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid.

And a brain spike. \n\nWe adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare \n\nCat Ferguson wrote a detailed article on the process at Topic: https://www.topic.com/how-to-kill-a-fish\n\nThis article about fish and pain from the Smithsonian informed reporting: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/fish-feel-pain-180967764/ \n\nAnd here’s a link to the Ike Jime Federation, where Andrew is the president: https://www.ikejimefederation.com/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
